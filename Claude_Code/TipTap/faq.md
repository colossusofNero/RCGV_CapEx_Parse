# TipTap - Frequently Asked Questions

## The $20 Limit

### Q: Why is there a $20 limit on tips?
**A:** The $20 limit is strategically designed for regulatory compliance and user protection:
- **Micro-transaction regulation compliance** - Keeps us under regulatory thresholds that would require Money Transmitter Licenses (MTL)
- **Avoids complex licensing** - MTL requirements would add operational complexity and costs
- **Covers most tipping scenarios** - $20 is appropriate for standard service situations
- **Prevents accidental large payments** - No worrying about accidentally tipping large amounts
- **Streamlined operations** - Simpler regulatory structure allows us to focus on user experience
- **Reduced compliance costs** - Lower regulatory burden keeps our service affordable

### Q: What if I want to tip more than $20?
**A:** For situations requiring larger tips:
- Send multiple $20 transactions for larger amounts
- Use traditional payment methods for exceptional circumstances
- Remember that our $20 limit allows us to operate without Money Transmitter License requirements, keeping the service simple and cost-effective

### Q: Can I change or remove the $20 limit?
**A:** No, the $20 limit is fundamental to our regulatory structure and cannot be modified. This limit allows us to operate under micro-transaction regulations without requiring Money Transmitter Licenses, keeping our service simple and compliant.
